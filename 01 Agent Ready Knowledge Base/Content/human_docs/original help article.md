# How to Cancel Your Subscription

You can cancel your subscription at any time directly from your account. Once cancelled, you’ll continue to have access until the end of your current billing period.

## Before You Get Started

- You must be logged in to your account
- Only account owners can cancel subscriptions
- If you’re on a trial, cancelling will immediately end your access

If you’re unsure whether you want to cancel, you can also downgrade your plan instead.

## What Happens After You Cancel

- Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle.
